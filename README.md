# smart_alarm
Alarm clock to run off of a raspberry pi

Before running for the first time, ensure that you have a client_secret file for your google calendar.

Next, ensure that you have a secret_config.json file in this directory. An easy solution is just `cp example_config.json secret_config.json` and fill in the appropriate fields. 

To setup everything for your pi, run `setup`.
